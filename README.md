# Iris-DataSet
 This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset using Python's Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, contains measurements of 150 iris flowers across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
# 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis with Python

This project explores the classic **Iris dataset** using Python's Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries. The goal is to perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize patterns within the dataset.

📄 Project Description
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset using Python's Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, contains measurements of 150 iris flowers across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The goal of this project is to:

Understand the structure and distribution of the data

Compute and interpret basic statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)

Identify relationships between features using correlation analysis

Visualize patterns, distributions, and potential species-level clusters through various charts

Key Features:
Uses both Jupyter Notebook and Python scripts for reproducibility

Includes histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and pairplots

Computes and exports summary statistics and correlation matrix

Structured for clarity, with organized folders for data and visuals

This project is a great introduction to data analysis and visualization for beginners in Python or data science.

## 📌 Project Description

The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*). Each flower has four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

In this project, we:
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Compute summary statistics (mean, median, std, mode)
- Analyze feature correlations
- Visualize the data using histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and pairplots

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Histogram of feature distributions
- Boxplot of sepal length by species
- Heatmap showing correlations between features
- Pairplot showing relationships across all features grouped by species
